ActsAsSimilar
=============

I had a need to find items that were similar to an item. I looked at acts_as_recommendable, and while this was very
nice plugin, it was too slow when working with large data sets. I also decided that the results I needed didn't need
to be scientifically accurate, just a rough match. So I created this plugin to allow for a very elementary way to find items
that are similar to the object you are working with. This works best when used with a has_many :through relationship.

Basically all it is doing is looking for other objects of the same class, that have some related value.


Example 1
=========

class PlaylistsVideo
  belongs_to :video
  belongs_to :playlist
end

class Video
  has_many :playlists_videos
  has_many :playlists, :through => :playlists_videos
end

class Playlist
  has_many :playlists_videos
  has_many :videos, :through => :playlists_videos

  acts_as_similar :videos
end

@playlist = Playlist.first
@playlist.similar
